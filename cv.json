I was instantly offered a part-time position after the internship and moved to an apprenticeship position on my last year of school. It's a small firm so I worked on a variety of different technologies which helped fast track my learning a lot. <br>After finishing my conscript military service in June, 2021, I was offered a full time position and was given responsibility of a big project including working face-to-face with clients on a daily basis."
